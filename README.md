# Simple ToDo app in ClojureScript and Re-Frame
This is a simple ToDo app in [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)
that uses [Re-Frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame).

The list is stored in a set, so you can't have the same item twice in the list.

The Reagent version can be found here: https://github.com/thomas-shares/todo-app

This app is based on code written by Snugug as published here:
https://codepen.io/Snugug/pen/yOXemR

## Usage
The app uses [boot](http://boot-clj.com/), for development just type the following on the command line:
```boot dev``` and then point your browser at http://localhost:3000
